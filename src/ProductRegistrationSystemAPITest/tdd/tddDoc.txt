TDD (TEST DRIVE DEVELOPMENT)
****************************

-DESCRIPTION-

To follow the TDD approach, start by writing a failing test. 
Then, write the necessary code to make the test pass. 
Once the test passes, you can add more tests to cover other use cases of your API.




-HOW TO MAKE ?-


1) WRITE TESTS SMALLEST AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

2) WRITE TESTS THAT COVER EVERYTHING CASES ABOUT API.

3) USE ASSERTIONS FOR CHECK AND REVIEW CALLS
